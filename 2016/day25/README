Reverse ingeneer the input code.

1. From input to input_labels:
Implement jumps with labels and gotos

2. From input_labels to input_C
Implement the code as C code with minimising the gotos

3. Notice that we are looking at the binary representation of the input number!

4. Find a so that bin(a+4*633) = '10'*n
