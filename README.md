# Purpose

Practical python-training on a series of algorithmic puzzles.


# Audience

This is of poor interest in it-self.

Any comments from pythonistas are welcomed! (to help me get better)


# Advent of code 

quote from http://adventofcode.com/2017/about

    Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill
    levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who
    wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code.
    Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a
    theme.
